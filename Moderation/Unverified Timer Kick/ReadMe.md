This system handles kicking of users if they didn't agree to the rules within a certain amount of time. This can be helpful to avoid idle users or bots that don't "verify"


Instructions to get started from the YAGPDB Support Discord server:
```1. Create a verified role or "members" role and give it all the general permissions the @everyone role would typically have. Make sure that the @everyone has no permissions.
2. Create a rolemenu that gives the verified role in the desired channel (type ;rm in ‚Å†testing for a tutorial on how to do so).
3. Make sure to create permission overrides in the channel for the @everyone role so that users are able to view and react to the message.```

The role you create from the instructions above will be the `<roleid>` you use in the KickCC.
