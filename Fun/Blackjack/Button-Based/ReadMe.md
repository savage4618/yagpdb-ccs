Credit to [Ranger](https://github.com/Ranger-4297/YAGPDB-ccs/tree/main/Economy/Plugins/Blackjack) for initially writing this CC. I modified it (with permission) to work with a **MUCH** less complicated economy system that is compatible with the YAGPDB Public Repository's economy ("CREDITS").

There's not much needed to set up this command, all you should need to do is set the `$currency` variable in both blackjack_buttons.yagcc and blackjack_components.yagcc to match your exiting currency system, and then paste in all the code to your dashboard.

If either code doesn't save due to being too long, remove the comments at the beginning of the files.
